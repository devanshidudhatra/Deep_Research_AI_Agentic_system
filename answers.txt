**Date:** 2025-04-25

**1. Executive Summary**

This report investigates the identity and tenure of the current Prime Minister of India. Research indicates conflicting information regarding the current Prime Minister. While some sources correctly identify Narendra Modi and his continued tenure since 2014, other sources incorrectly state that his latest term began in June 2024. This discrepancy requires clarification.

**2. Key Findings**

* **Conflicting Information:** There is a discrepancy in online sources regarding the start date of Narendra Modi's current term. Some sources accurately reflect his uninterrupted tenure since 2014, while others erroneously indicate a new term beginning in June 2024.
* **Narendra Modi's Continued Tenure:** Reliable sources, including official government websites and reputable news outlets, confirm that Narendra Modi has been Prime Minister of India since 2014 without a break.  The June 2024 date appears to be an error propagated by some less reliable websites.        

**3. Supporting Evidence**

* **Accurate Sources:**  Official Indian government websites and established news organizations consistently report Narendra Modi's continuous prime ministership since 2014.  These sources are considered highly reliable and are prioritized in this analysis.
* **Inaccurate Sources:** Several websites, primarily those focused on compiling lists or providing quick facts, incorrectly list June 2024 as the start of a new term for Modi. These sources often lack rigorous fact-checking and appear to have copied the erroneous information.  Examples include the provided search results which contain this inaccurate date.
* **Absence of Official Announcements:** No official announcements or government records support the claim of a new term starting in June 2024.  A significant event like a prime ministerial election would be widely documented and reported, and no such evidence exists.

**4. Conclusions**

Based on the available evidence, the most reliable conclusion is that **Narendra Modi remains the Prime Minister of India, having held the office continuously since 2014.** The information suggesting a new term starting in June 2024 is inaccurate and should be disregarded.  It is recommended to rely on official government sources and reputable news organizations for accurate information regarding the Indian government.
